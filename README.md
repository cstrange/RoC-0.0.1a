Ruins of Chance - concept of browser based game

Ruins of Chance is little more than an idea at the moment.
The concept is a browser based role playing game that goes beyond some of the games that I have played for some years now. I make no claim that it will be better than anything, it is basically my baby and my journey through learning Ruby on Rails among other things. Contributors are welcome for additions to the concept, but I am not truly looking for anyone to help with code at this time. Because it is a mere concept and very little is shared at the moment, any help coding would not be even remotely close to a good idea. Once the concept is hammered into at least a rough form, then maybe I will seek help with coding and maintaining the repo.
